secrets, secrets are no funâ€¦

Feel the need to put something out there? Not sure what to do next?

This website allows people to input a secret or something that has been weighing on them, and receive something in return that will reframe their thoughts. 

The idea came out of the problem of not having an outlet. There is a lot going on in our lives, both internally, and externally within the world.

The jumbled words and responses allow people to view their problems in a different way.
